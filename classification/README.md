This project focuses on predicting heart disease using various machine-learning classification algorithms. The models compared include Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

The performance of each model is evaluated using confusion matrices, and the best-performing models were found to be Decision Tree and Random Forest, offering the highest accuracy in prediction. This project involves steps such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
