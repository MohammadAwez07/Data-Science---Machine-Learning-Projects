**Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning**
## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on building a classification model to predict heart disease based on various medical features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other diagnostic attributes. Multiple machine-learning models were developed and evaluated using a heart disease dataset to determine the most accurate and reliable model for predicting heart disease.

The project aims to assist in the early detection of heart disease by leveraging machine learning algorithms, helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions.

## **Key Features**
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and transforming categorical variables.
Model Training: Implemented machine learning classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated models based on accuracy and error metrics (e.g., confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score) to identify the best-performing model.
Result Analysis: Compared model performance across training and test datasets, ensuring minimal overfitting and effective generalization.

## **Workflow**
Data collection and preprocessing (handling missing values and scaling features).
Training multiple machine learning models on the processed data.
Evaluation of models using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
