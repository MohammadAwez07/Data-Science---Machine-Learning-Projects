# **House Price Prediction using Machine Learning**
## **Project Overview**
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, grade, view, and other property attributes. Using a real-world housing dataset, multiple machine learning models were trained, evaluated, and compared to identify the best-performing model for predicting property prices.

The project involves a comprehensive machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. The final model provides accurate predictions with minimal overfitting, helping to generalize the performance to unseen data.

## **Key Features**
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting categorical features to binary, and binning continuous variables to create a more structured dataset.
Model Training: Implementation of various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and more to predict house prices.
Model Evaluation: Evaluation of models based on accuracy and error metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), identifying the best model with maximum generalization capability.
Result Analysis: Comparison of model performance on training and test datasets, ensuring the final model minimizes overfitting and maximizes generalization.
Data Visualization: Use of visualizations to understand data distributions, model accuracy, and performance metrics.
