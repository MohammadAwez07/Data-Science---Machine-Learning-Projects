# **Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning**
## **Project Overview**
This project aims to perform customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer purchasing behavior, demographics, and other relevant features, customers are grouped into segments that share similar characteristics. These segments can then be used by businesses for targeted marketing, product recommendations, and improving customer experience.

The project implements clustering algorithms to uncover hidden patterns and trends in customer data, allowing companies to better understand their customer base.

## **Key Features**
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, standardizing numeric variables, and transforming categorical variables where necessary.
Clustering: Applied unsupervised learning methods like K-Means clustering and hierarchical clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing patterns and other attributes.
Cluster Evaluation: Evaluated the quality of clusters using methods like the Silhouette Score and inertia to ensure meaningful customer groups.
Visualization: Visualized the results of customer segmentation using plots to highlight distinct customer clusters and their features.

## **Worflow**
Data preprocessing, including handling missing data and normalizing features.
Exploration of customer data to identify key features for clustering.
Implementation of K-Means and other clustering algorithms for segmentation.
Evaluation of clustering performance using metrics such as Silhouette Score.
Visualization of clusters to interpret and present results.

## **Tools and Technologies**
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
Clustering: Scikit-learn
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## **Results**
The project successfully segmented customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic attributes. The clustering results can be used to design personalized marketing strategies, product offerings, and improve overall customer engagement.
